# Pilot exact-tool discovery

## Observed failure

In the local scientific pilot, an explicit `TaskExecutorAgent` request named
`dataset_overview_heracleum_tox` and included its discovered server ID. The
request reached `ToolPipelineAgent`, but its `ToolRetrieverAgent` ended without
calling `retrieve_tools`. The downstream reranker then rejected the explicit
target because it was absent from that executor invocation's tool inventory:
`Explicit target tool dataset_overview_heracleum_tox was not retrieved`.

A separate broad executor request also failed after some MCP tools returned
data, with `ExperimentAgent cannot finish without a successful scientific MCP
call`. This design does not claim to resolve that receipt-accounting failure.

## Behavior

Only the `synapse_pilot` profile gains an after-model callback on
`ToolRetrieverAgent`. When its non-partial response is final and the incoming
task names an explicit `Target tool: <name>`, the callback checks the actual
`accumulated_tools` state. A matching tool with a server ID satisfies the
requirement. If it is absent, the callback returns one real ADK
`retrieve_tools(query=<name>)` function call. The result must pass through the
existing retrieval tool and populate the normal state; the callback never
invents tool metadata or a scientific result.

The callback records one exact-name attempt per invocation. If the target is
still absent after that attempt, it raises a clear error rather than looping
or allowing the reranker to continue with an unrelated tool. Requests without
an explicit target, partial model responses, and normal model-originated tool
calls retain their current behavior. No Synapse contract or other CoScientist
profile changes.

The pilot executor's existing handoff must preserve both the target name and
its server ID when forwarding to `ToolPipelineAgent`; repeating only the name
does not satisfy the identity constraint. Model error, interruption, and
contentless control responses must pass through without triggering retrieval.

## Alternatives

- Add another prompt instruction: smaller text change, but the retriever
  already had a mandatory-call instruction and skipped it in the observed run.
- Call the RAG retriever directly inside the reranker callback: avoids an ADK
  round trip, but bypasses the normal observable tool-call path.
- Use the existing ADK tool path with one callback-generated exact query:
  selected because the call and response remain visible and bounded.

## Verification and scope

Write a failing regression for a final retriever response with a named target
missing from state, then verify the generated call and one-attempt limit.
Cover a present target, missing server ID, no target, partial response, and
model-originated tool call. Run an in-memory ADK Runner test with a stubbed
`retrieve_tools` transport so it observes the real call/response path. Build
the pilot image and test one targeted executor invocation before attempting
another full scientific project. Keep PR #401 draft until the remaining
receipt-accounting failure and end-to-end report are separately verified.
