"""The session's own copy of every file a run produced.

A tool that renders a figure hands back a presigned URL to *its* storage. One
such link, measured on a live run, was valid for six minutes: issued at 12:29:56
and expired at 12:35:29. We stored the string and never fetched the bytes, so by
the time anyone opened the graph the artifact was gone for good. Across six
sessions, 77 of 88 indexed artifacts had no durable reference at all.

So the bytes come here, at the moment the link still works, and this directory —
beside the graph snapshots, inside what export already packs — is the primary
copy. S3 is a secondary address, not the home.

    <GRAPH_SNAPSHOT_DIR>/sessions/<user>/<session>/
        artifacts.json              # the existing index (unchanged)
        artifacts/manifest.json     # one record per artifact_id
        artifacts/files/<id>        # the bytes

**The reference carries no session.** Graph attrs, the index and report markdown
all store ``cos-artifact:<artifact_id>``, and the URL is built from whatever
scope is rendering. That is what lets an exported bundle open on another machine
under a new session id without rewriting a single link — which is the whole
reason for the indirection.

Ids are content-addressed (``<slug>-<sha8><ext>``), so the same figure captured
twice under two different signatures is one record and one file.

Nothing here raises. A file that cannot be stored becomes a record saying so,
with a reason code: a report that silently lost an illustration reads exactly
like one that never had it.
