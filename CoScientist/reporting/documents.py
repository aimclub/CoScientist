"""Long results become documents; the chat keeps a summary and a button.

An agent's deliverable, an experiment plan, a work report — each of them runs to
tens of kilobytes, and printing one into the feed buries every message around
it. The convention this module generalises was already written down for the
ГОСТ ТЗ, in ``context_init/tz_agent.announcement``:

    Короткое намеренно. Тело документа в ленту не выгружается — карточку и
    ссылку читают глазами, а стена текста в чате хоронит и то и другое.

So the body is written as Markdown into the session's own artifact store, the
chat gets two or three lines and a button, and the panel opens the file. Because
the store is the same one every other artifact uses, a document costs nothing
extra: it is content-addressed, it is deduplicated, it rides along in an
exported session, and a ``cos-artifact:`` reference to it survives an import
under a new session id.

Nothing here raises. A document that cannot be written is a document the chat
message does without — the message still goes out, whole, exactly as before.
