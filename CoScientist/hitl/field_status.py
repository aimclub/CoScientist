"""Per-field provenance status, shared by structured HITL intakes.

Lifted from the microfluidics ТЗ model (``microfluidics/models.py``) so every
structured intake — the ТЗ and the research frame (``context_init/models.py``) —
uses one status vocabulary. A field is "open" when it has no usable value yet.
That is what a HITL form uses to decide which fields to ask the human to fill.

Statuses are plain string Literals (not an Enum) so the dicts ADK stores in
session state and injects into downstream prompts render as readable text.
