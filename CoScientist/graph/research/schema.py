"""Meta-model schema for the Research Context Graph.

The single source of truth for node types, statuses, status transitions, edge
types (with allowed endpoint type pairs) and per-agent write permissions.
Both the write-validation (store.commit) and the agent prompt sections
(templates.render_research_protocol) render from these tables, so what an agent
is told it may write and what the graph actually accepts can never drift.

Canonical identifiers are English; the spec's Russian terms are accepted on
input via RU_ALIASES and normalized before validation (the EN↔RU mapping is
documented in docs/research_graph.md).
