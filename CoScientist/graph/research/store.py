"""Persistent, schema-validated store for the Research Context Graph.

One active research per user/session scope (one graph = one root question), held
in a NetworkX MultiDiGraph (parallel typed edges like E1-supports→H1 plus
E1-relates_to→H1 must coexist) and snapshotted atomically to JSON after every
write — the blackboard survives restarts, browser refresh and Web Stop. An
explicit reset or re-initialization archives the previous active graph first;
refuted branches remain available as negative results in that archive.

Writes go through ``commit`` — the transactional API from spec §5.3: ALL nodes,
edges and status changes of one agent step are validated together against the
schema (types, per-agent permissions, status transitions, edge endpoint pairs)
and either applied atomically or rejected with instructive per-item errors.

# ── projection: from the record to the drawing ───────────────────────────────
# The store keeps the whole engineering record — datasets, code, tools, budget,
# cost models — and the canvas is read as a scientific narrative, in which those
# outnumber the findings. They are NOT dropped: each is folded into the card it
# belongs to, as a chip on the method that used it or an attachment on the
# evidence it produced, and the panel still shows it in full.
#
# The viewer used to do this filtering on the client, by name, and threw away
# every edge that touched a hidden node. In a real session the entire structure
# of the graph hung off GeneratedData, so that was 100% of the edges: the canvas
# drew eleven cards and not one line between them. Folding belongs here, where
# the structure is known and an edge can be re-pointed at the card that absorbed
# its endpoint instead of being discarded.

#: Drawn as cards of their own: the scientific record, plus the PLAN beside it.
#: A PlanStep is not part of the record — it is the intention the record was
#: made against — so the viewer draws it in its own column rather than in the
#: band flow, keyed on `track: "plan"`. It still has to be projected, or the
#: reader cannot see what was intended and what came of it.

        this record exists to prevent. It also validates nothing, moves no

        idle study look freshly worked on.
