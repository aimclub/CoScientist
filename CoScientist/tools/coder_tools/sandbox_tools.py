"""ADK tools exposing the OpenHands sandbox to the CoderAgent.

The portable client lives in :mod:`openhands_sandbox` and knows nothing about
ADK. This module is the thin adapter that makes it usable as agent tools:

* **Async.** ADK invokes a *sync* function tool directly on the event loop, so a
  blocking wait would freeze the whole system (web UI, SSE log streaming, every
  other agent) for as long as the sandbox runs — up to hours. Every tool here is
  a coroutine using the client's async API.
* **Bounded inline wait.** Mirrors the ``execute_bash`` / ``check_job`` idiom the
  CoderAgent already knows: the call waits inline for the result, and only hands
  back ``status="running"`` when the task outlives that wait — so the model
  usually gets its answer in ONE call instead of burning turns on polling.
* **One session identity.** The sandbox session is keyed by the SAME id as the
  coder's own workspace (:meth:`CoderToolset._workspace_id`), so an explicit
  ``CODER_WORKSPACE_ID`` pin (A2A), the ADK state pin and the session id all
  behave identically for both environments.
* **Live links out of band.** Because the call only returns when the job is
  over, the ``watch_url`` / ``vscode_url`` in its result reach a UI too late to
  watch anything. So a host (the Web app) registers a sink with
  :func:`set_sandbox_start_sink` and gets them the moment the container is up.
* **Cost out of band too.** What the run cost (its agent's tokens, GPU seconds,
  electricity) travels on the client's metrics channel into the session ledger,
  never through the tool result — see :func:`_metrics_sink`.

Note that the sandbox is a *separate* machine from the coder's ``execute_bash``
workspace: files do not cross between them. Data goes in through ``dataset_url``
and results come back as the sandbox agent's summary (plus the workspace listing
and the live console / VS Code URLs).

    Delegate a heavy, long-running or GPU-bound job to the OpenHands sandbox —
    a separate, isolated machine where an autonomous coding agent carries the

    The sandbox is bound to your session: the FIRST call creates it, and every
    later call continues in the SAME sandbox, keeping its `/workspace` files and
    its memory of what it already did. Drive one experiment forward with several
    successive calls (set up, then train, then evaluate) — each call sees the
    results of the previous one.

    This waits inline for the result. Only if the job outlives that wait does it
    return status "running"; then call `check_sandbox_task()` ONCE later — never

    IMPORTANT — this is NOT your `execute_bash` workspace. It is a different

    `dataset_url`; get results back through the returned summary, and verify
    them with `list_sandbox_files`.
