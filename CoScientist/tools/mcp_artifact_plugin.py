"""Generic capture of artifact links returned by MCP tools.

Many MCP tools (e.g. the tox-antitargets suite) render a figure/table server-side
and return a *presigned URL* to it inside the tool result — commonly under a
``metadata.figure.artifact`` key or a ``*_presigned_url`` key. That link only
lives in the tool result envelope: with the Result Aggregator running graph-first
(``include_contents: none``) it never reaches the report unless it is captured.

This App-level plugin fires at every tool-call boundary and stashes each artifact
URL it finds into ``state["mcp_artifacts"]`` (a ``*_artifacts`` key the report
collector already downloads). It must run BEFORE the tool-result truncation plugin
so it still sees the full, untruncated URL.

Distinct from :mod:`CoScientist.tools.fedot_artifact_plugin`, which captures S3
CSV links *inside* a nested FEDOT.MAS run; this one is generic and global.
