"""ADK function tools wrapping the Alembic pipeline (GitHub repo → MCP server).

Alembic (CoScientist/alembic) builds a validated FastMCP tool server from a
scientific repository inside Docker. A full build takes tens of minutes, so the
tools here are job-based: ``build_mcp_server`` launches ``start_chain.py`` as a
host-side background subprocess and returns a ``job_id``; ``check_mcp_build``
reports progress (current pipeline stage, log tail) and, once the serve
container is up, the resulting MCP endpoint URL.

Jobs are process-wide (like the coder's local job registry), so over A2A —
where every orchestrator delegation is a fresh session — a later delegation can
find and continue an earlier build via ``list_mcp_builds``.
