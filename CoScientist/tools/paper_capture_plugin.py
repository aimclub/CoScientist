"""Recognise the papers a run finds, and keep them as papers.

A run finds literature two ways and only one of them was ever watched. The
papers server (`search_papers`, `download_papers_from_search`) returns a tidy
record, and a callback collected it. But in practice the ResearchAgent reaches
for the web: a live session made seven Tavily calls and not one call to the
papers server, and the evidence it committed cited `PMC12610272` — a paper the
run had genuinely read and had no copy of.

Two things were wrong, and this plugin fixes the first.

**It is a plugin, not an after_tool callback.** ADK runs plugin callbacks first
and the agent's own only when no plugin answered, so the truncation plugin —
which answered on every result over 12 000 characters — was silently cancelling
the agent's chain on exactly the big web-search results that carry papers. That
is fixed in `agents/truncation_plugin.py`; being a plugin here means this never
depended on it in the first place, and it also reaches tools called inside an
AgentTool child.

**It re-files rather than re-fetches.** `McpArtifactCapturePlugin` runs before
this one and has already mirrored any `.pdf` link a result carried. A second
download of the same bytes would produce the same content-addressed id at the
cost of another request to someone else's server, so a paper already in the
store is simply re-filed as one.

What counts as a paper is decided by `link_registry.classify_url`, the
classifier the link table already renders into every agent's prompt — so this
cannot drift from what a reader is told a link is. A PDF on a publisher's host
is a paper; the same PDF on a ministry's host is a document, and stays one.
