"""Bridge: a freshly served MCP server → the tool registry + this run's state.

An Alembic build ends with a served FastMCP endpoint (``alembic_tools``'
``build_mcp_server`` reports its ``mcp_url``), but nothing puts that server
where CoScientist can find it. The catalogue therefore never grows: the next
run has no idea the tool exists and re-does the work.

This module closes both halves of that gap:

  (a) :func:`register_mcp_server` ingests the server **and its tools** into the
      rag_tools registry, so ``Retrieve_tools`` finds it in later runs and on
      other machines — the durable catalogue;
  (b) :func:`resolve_into_state` puts the served url into
      ``state['deployed_mcps']`` — the shape
      :class:`~CoScientist.tools.dynamic_tools.DynamicMCPToolset` reads — so the
      executor can call the tool immediately, without waiting for a retrieval
      round.

The two are called at different moments, which is why they are separate. (a)
happens when the build finishes, whether or not anybody is asking, because a
tool missing from the catalogue is a tool the next run builds again. (b) needs
a live session, so it happens when a build is polled from one.

``register_mcp_server`` connects to the live server to enumerate its tools, so
the server must be serving at ``mcp_url`` when it is called.
