"""Self-contained S3 transfer helpers for the generated server.py.

Copied verbatim into ``output/helpers/s3_transfer.py`` by codegen
(``write_server``) so the served MCP boundary can hand back S3 references
instead of paths that only exist inside the build container. Deliberately
stdlib + a LAZILY imported ``boto3`` — never at module level — because this
module is loaded inside ``.venv-server``, which the wrapper only guarantees
carries fastmcp/mcp (+ boto3 when S3 is configured); importing boto3 eagerly
here would break every server that has no S3 configured.

v2 scoping model: every generated tool declares optional ``user_id``/
``session_id`` parameters that ``SessionScopePlugin`` (CoScientist/tools/
session_scope_plugin.py) fills in at the ADK tool-call boundary when the
caller leaves them blank — that is the primary path. This module also
exposes ``scope_from_headers``, which reads the ``X-Coscientist-User`` /
``X-Coscientist-Session`` request headers; it exists as a dormant fallback
for ``server.py`` to reach for when the params come back empty (an old
client bypassing the plugin, stdio transport, or an old fastmcp with no
header access) — nothing in this codebase currently sends those headers.
Both paths fall back to a shared ``("local", "default")`` scope when they
have nothing. This is a namespacing convenience, NOT a security
boundary — a presigned URL grants access to whoever holds it.

Error asymmetry (by design, see README): a failed *input* download
(``resolve_input``/``_download_s3``/``_download_http``) raises and fails the
whole tool call — a tool cannot silently run on the wrong/missing data. A
failed *output* upload (``maybe_upload``) only logs to stderr and returns
``None`` — an otherwise-successful tool call must not be turned into a
failure just because publishing its result to S3 did not work.

    A single nested dict, not the flat ``<key>_s3_key`` / ``<key>
    _presigned_url`` siblings this used to add: the framework's artifact
    walker (CoScientist/utils/s3_refs.py:_walk) only records a durable
    reference from a dict that carries BOTH ``bucket`` and ``s3_key`` as
    literal keys — a ``bucket``-less sibling pair sitting next to each other
    at the same level is invisible to it, since a bare ``s3_key`` cannot say
    which bucket holds it. The walker recurses into nested dicts, so this one
    is found the same way every MCP server's own return contract is (see
    mcp-servers/chemical-mcp-server/server/utils/vault.py:contract).
