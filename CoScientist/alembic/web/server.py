"""Run the alembic pipeline dashboard locally.

Usage:
    python -m alembic.web.server
    # or
    python CoScientist/alembic/web/server.py

The pipeline writes its workdir under ``.alembic/`` relative to the current
working directory (same as the CLI), so launch this from the same place you
would run ``python CoScientist/alembic/main.py``.

# The inner ``CoScientist/`` package contains a ``logging/`` sub-package that

# ``logging`` FIRST so it is cached — otherwise uvicorn/asyncio's own
# ``import logging`` (triggered after the path insert below) resolves to the
# shadow and the server dies at boot. ``logging`` is the *only* stdlib-name
# collision in that package, so this one pre-import is sufficient.
