# Checkpoint control access and notification delivery

## Administrative trust boundary

All five operations under `/api/checkpoints` (including the web app's
router) require `Authorization: Bearer <credential>`.
Set `CHECKPOINTS__API_TOKEN` to a randomly generated secret of at least
32 characters, supplied through deployment secret configuration.
The value is a Pydantic `SecretStr`; never put it in a URL, agent prompt,
frontend bundle, browser storage, or an AgentCard.

This credential grants **instance-administrator access to every Run and
checkpoint in the dedicated CoScientist instance**. It belongs only to the
trusted Synapse backend. Synapse checks end-user tenant/project/Run/point
permissions before invoking this API. The adapter validates the administrative
credential on every operation; it does not validate per-user Run claims.
Ordinary A2A clients must not receive this credential.

This is not multi-tenant isolation inside CoScientist: bundles include shared
process stores and cross-run knowledge memory. A manifest's `run_id` alone
cannot safely authorize a different tenant to download the ZIP. Different
trust domains need separate instances/storage or a separate isolation design.
Registration and restore are also privileged because they mutate shared state.

Responses:

- Missing configuration: **503**, all control operations remain closed.
  Local checkpoint capture and ordinary A2A execution still work.
- Missing, wrong, or non-Bearer credential: **401**, without reading checkpoint
  storage or changing session/registry/store state.
- Valid administrator credential: existing request/response shapes and busy
  restore protection are unchanged.

The unauthenticated web panel explains that checkpoint management is available
through Synapse. It does not embed the administrator credential.

## Synapse configuration

Configure the CoScientist A2A server connection in Synapse with its existing
authentication setting:

```json
{"auth": {"type": "bearer", "token_env": "COSCIENTIST_CHECKPOINT_TOKEN"}}
```

The Synapse backend's `COSCIENTIST_CHECKPOINT_TOKEN` must contain the same secret
as CoScientist's `CHECKPOINTS__API_TOKEN`. Its existing CheckpointClient forwards
this operational authentication to registration and restore. Server-to-server
bundle download must also supply it. A `snapshot_ref` is an identifier/URL, not
a public signed download link. Keep TLS or a trusted private transport between
the two services; this setting does not secure the separate A2A data API.

Existing deployments enabling checkpoints must configure both sides before
upgrading. An unconfigured deployment will receive a closed control API, not an
anonymous compatibility fallback. This change does not automatically modify
any deployment secrets.

## Notification delivery

After a bundle is saved locally, capture enqueues the existing snapshot-ready
payload and returns. One process-wide worker thread sends requests; the event
loop and other A2A servers do not wait for callback HTTP.

The queue holds at most **64 waiting notifications plus one in flight**.
Each HTTP attempt uses a **5-second HTTPX timeout**. There are no automatic
retries. Overflow, non-success HTTP status, transport failure, and incomplete
shutdown produce `[SNAPSHOT_NOTIFY]` warnings identifying the point, without
logging callback URLs or payloads. Failures leave the bundle on disk.
Normal process exit allows up to five seconds for draining; forced termination
and prolonged outages can lose notifications. The queue is not a durable outbox
and does not promise eventual delivery. Operators can inspect/list local
checkpoints through the authenticated control API.

OTel export remains independently handled by `BatchSpanProcessor`.

## Verification without LLM calls

```sh
LLM__MAIN_MODEL=test-model uv run --frozen pytest \
  tests/test_checkpoint_auth.py tests/test_snapshot_notifications.py \
  tests/test_synapse_bridge.py tests/test_synapse_otel.py \
  tests/test_synapse_trace_context.py tests/test_synapse_remote_context.py \
  tests/test_synapse_a2a_boundary.py tests/test_synapse_native_a2a.py \
  tests/test_synapse_remote_a2a.py -q
LLM__MAIN_MODEL=test-model uv run --frozen python tests/e2e_synapse_v1.py
LLM__MAIN_MODEL=test-model uv run --frozen python tests/e2e_checkpoint_control.py
```

The HTTP scenario uses scripted ADK agents, not a model. Test credentials are
local fixtures, not deployment credentials.
