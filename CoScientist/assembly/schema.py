"""Pydantic schema + loader for ``system.yaml``.

The YAML declares every agent of the system in one place. Per agent:

  class:        llm | sequential | parallel | loop | custom:<registered name>
                (`loop` repeats its children until a child escalates; cap it
                with options.max_iterations)
  enabled:      bool, or "${settings.path}" resolved against app settings —
                a disabled agent is still BUILT (so it can be served standalone
                over A2A) but is not attached to / advertised by its parents
  model:        "main" | "coder" | "nir" | a literal litellm model string
  reasoning:    model "thinking" for this agent — false/"off" to switch it off,
                or "minimal"|"low"|"medium"|"high"; unset inherits defaults
  prompt:       name of a registered prompt template
  tools:        registered tool names
  subordinates: agents attached as AgentTool (and rendered into <<AGENTS>>/<<ROUTING>>)
  children:     composite children (sequential/parallel execution order)
  callbacks:    {before_model|after_model|before_tool|after_tool|before_agent|after_agent: [names]}
  hitl:         whether the agent uses human-in-the-loop (tools + prompt section
                for llm agents, review-loop handler for session agents)
  work_order:   before acting, the agent declares a Work Order (goal, assumptions,
                steps, tools, side effects) for the human to review, and
                a guard keeps it inside the approved contract (llm agents with
                hitl only; see CoScientist/hitl/work_order.py)
  work_order_step_review: every finished step of the Work Order goes before the
                human — what was sent, expected and found (needs work_order)
  critic:       an LLM critic reviews the agent's output once and it rewrites
                on request (session agents only; bool or "${settings.path}")
  report_output: the agent's final answer is a deliverable — show it in the chat
  internal:     plumbing agent (pipeline stage, composite wrapper) — hidden in the web UI
  output_key / output_schema / planner / options: passthrough constructor config
                (an ``options`` value may be "${settings.path}" too)
  a2a:          how the agent is exposed as an A2A service (key, port, skill, env)

A config may also start with ``extends: <name-or-path>``, inheriting another
config and overriding only the agents and fields it names — so a variant of the
system (a limited profile, a deployment with one agent off) is a short overlay
rather than a copy that drifts from the original. See :func:`_merge_raw`.
