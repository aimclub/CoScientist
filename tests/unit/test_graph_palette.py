"""Colour has to answer one question per channel, or it answers none.

The research canvas encodes three things at once: the card's colour is WHAT the
node is, the status word's colour is WHERE the claim stands, and the link's
colour is HOW two cards relate. Each of the ways that breaks is invisible —
nothing throws, nothing looks wrong on a small graph, and the reader simply
stops being able to tell two kinds of card apart:

* a type missing from ``R_KIND`` does not lose its colour, it inherits the
  STATUS colour, which is how ``Hypothesis`` (deliberately left out so it could
  carry its verdict) came out amber next to an orange ``Evidence``;
* two types sharing a hue look like one type — tool, dataset and code were all
  ``#a9682a``, and conclusion, report and publication all ``#fb923c``;
* a type taking green or red makes an ordinary card read as a verdict.

These are cheap checks against the server's own list of node types, so a new
type cannot be added without being given a colour.
