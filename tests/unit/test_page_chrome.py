"""A publisher's furniture is not an illustration of the run.

Every URL below is real: they come from one session's artifact manifest, where
reading two article pages brought home eighteen viewer icons of 141–720 bytes,
two journal logos, a publisher logo, an avatar placeholder and an author's
photograph — 23 of 36 stored artifacts — all of which would have been offered
to the reader in the report's Figures section.

The seven genuine figures of the paper were in the same manifest, from the same
host. So the cut cannot be by size: a journal banner in that session was 22 007
bytes and a real figure was 22 477. It is by path segment, because that is where
the two actually differ — and `img` and `images` are different segments.
