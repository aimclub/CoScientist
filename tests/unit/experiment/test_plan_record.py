"""The plan is recorded in the call graph, and reaches the human structured.

Two records and one delivery, all of the same plan:

* the execution (call) graph gets a ``decision`` node hanging off the planner's
  activation, carrying the structured plan, opened when the plan is proposed and
  closed with whatever the human answered;
* the HITL request carries that same structure in ``context.experiment_plan``,
  next to the Markdown in ``context.output`` the console still uses.

Before this, a plan left no trace in the call graph at all and reached the
browser only as Markdown, so a plan sent back for revision was recoverable from
nothing but the log.
