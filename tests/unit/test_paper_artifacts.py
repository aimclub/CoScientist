"""A found paper becomes a file, and the evidence that cites it can open it.

The failure these cover is one a live session showed: the ResearchAgent found a
relevant paper, and everything downstream — the markdown document on the right
of the chat, the Evidence node in the research graph — carried one thing, the
DOI, as a bare string. No file, no link, nothing to click.

Two halves. `paper_library` keeps the citation (title, year, DOI, address) that
`print_research_agent_tool_call` used to throw away, keeping only an S3 key;
`capture_paper_downloads` brings the bytes into the session store. The join
between them is the **normalized** DOI, because three sources spell the same one
three ways.
